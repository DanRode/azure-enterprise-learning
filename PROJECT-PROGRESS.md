# Azure Enterprise Learning - Project Progress

## Phase 1: MVP Infrastructure - COMPLETED ✅

**Date Completed:** September 4, 2025  
**Duration:** ~4 hours  
**Infrastructure Cost:** ~$2-3/day  

### What We Built

**Architecture:**
```
Resource Group (dev-learn-rg)
├── VNet (10.0.0.0/16)
│   ├── AKS Subnet (10.0.1.0/24)
│   └── Database Subnet (10.0.2.0/24)
├── Network Security Groups
├── AKS Cluster (single B2s node)
├── Log Analytics Workspace
└── Deployed nginx application (publicly accessible)
```

**Terraform Modules Created:**
1. **Networking Module** (`terraform/modules/networking/`)
   - VNet with hardcoded subnets
   - NSGs with basic HTTP/HTTPS and PostgreSQL rules
   - Clean module interface (inputs/outputs)

2. **AKS Module** (`terraform/modules/aks/`)
   - Single-node Kubernetes cluster
   - Azure CNI networking
   - Azure AD integration
   - Log Analytics monitoring
   - Cost-optimized configuration

**Environment Configuration:**
- Dev environment (`terraform/environments/dev/`)
- Proper module integration with dependency chain
- Separate Terraform state file for dev environment

### Key Learning Outcomes

**Module Design Patterns:**
- ✅ Purpose-built modules vs. generic "factory" patterns
- ✅ Clean dependency management (RG → Networking → AKS)
- ✅ Required vs. optional variables (made tags required)
- ✅ Selective output exposure at environment level

**Azure/AKS Specifics:**
- ✅ Azure CNI vs. kubenet networking decisions
- ✅ Service CIDR vs. VNet CIDR separation (10.1.x vs. 10.0.x)
- ✅ Azure AD integration setup and kubelogin requirement
- ✅ Admin vs. user credentials for cluster access
- ✅ Load balancer automatic provisioning

**Infrastructure as Code:**
- ✅ Environment-specific Terraform state management
- ✅ Module reusability across environments
- ✅ Proper .gitignore for Terraform projects
- ✅ Cost optimization strategies (single node, basic tiers)

### What We Deployed and Tested

**Application Deployment:**
- ✅ Created Kubernetes manifest for nginx
- ✅ Deployed with LoadBalancer service
- ✅ Verified external accessibility (HTTP 200 responses)
- ✅ Tested pod scheduling and resource limits

**End-to-End Validation:**
- ✅ Terraform plan/apply workflow
- ✅ kubectl cluster connectivity
- ✅ Application deployment and traffic routing
- ✅ Azure Load Balancer integration
- ✅ Clean destruction process

### Design Decisions Made

**MVP Approach:**
- Hardcoded subnet addresses for simplicity
- Single-node cluster (no auto-scaling)
- Basic monitoring (30-day retention)
- Public endpoints (no private cluster)

**Security Baseline:**
- Azure AD integration enabled
- RBAC enabled
- Managed identities (system-assigned)
- NSG rules for required traffic only

**Cost Control:**
- B2s VM size (cheapest viable for AKS)
- Single replica deployment
- Basic Log Analytics tier
- Resource limits on applications

### Architecture Evolution Plan

**Phase 2 Candidates:**
- [ ] App Gateway integration
- [ ] Private endpoints for databases
- [ ] Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- [ ] Key Vault for secrets management
- [ ] PostgreSQL Flexible Server
- [ ] Multi-environment scaling (staging, prod)

**Future Improvements:**
- [ ] Variable subnet sizing based on environment
- [ ] Auto-scaling node pools
- [ ] Private AKS cluster
- [ ] GitOps deployment patterns
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup

### Success Metrics

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Single-command deployment (`terraform apply`)
- ✅ Predictable costs (~$2-3/day actual)
- ✅ Clean module boundaries and reusability

**Application:**
- ✅ Sub-1-minute application deployment
- ✅ External HTTP accessibility
- ✅ Proper Kubernetes resource scheduling

**Learning:**
- ✅ Module design patterns understood
- ✅ Azure networking concepts applied
- ✅ End-to-end troubleshooting experience
- ✅ Enterprise-ready foundation established
