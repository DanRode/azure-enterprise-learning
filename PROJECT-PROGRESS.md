   - ✅ Module design decisions documented
   - ✅ Daily cost control scripts in place
   - ✅ Enterprise ACR pattern designed and documented

2. **Terraform Backend Configuration**
   - ✅ Azure Storage Account created for state
   - ✅ Backend configuration tested
   - ✅ Multiple environment state isolation

3. **Networking Module Design**
   - ✅ Reusable VNet module created
   - ✅ Subnet configuration for AKS
   - ✅ Network security group baseline

4. **AKS Module Design**

   - ✅ RBAC integration ready
   - ✅ Basic monitoring configuration

### Currently Working On 🔄

1. **Enterprise ACR Integration**
   - ✅ ACR resource configuration (Basic SKU)
   - 🔄 Service principal permissions elevation (needs Owner role)
   - 🔄 AKS-ACR role assignment automation
   - 🔄 Container promotion workflow documentation

### Next Steps 📋

1. **Service Principal Elevation**
   ```bash
   # Grant temporary Owner role for learning environment
   az role assignment create 
     --assignee b5422da7-4709-4cdd-9ca4-47ea063df820 
     --role Owner 
     --scope /subscriptions/7a5bee06-2155-4808-885b-ba1c53c04dbd
   ```

2. **ACR Configuration Updates**
   - Update ACR naming to reflect shared pattern: `sharedlearnacr`
   - Verify AKS kubelet identity role assignment
   - Test container pull capabilities

3. **Container Promotion Workflow**
   - Document image tagging strategy (commit SHA → environment tags)
   - Create promotion automation scripts
   - Test with sample applications

## Phase 2: Application Integration 📅 Planned

### Database & Secrets (Inline Resources)

- PostgreSQL Flexible Server configuration
- Key Vault for application secrets
- Connection string management

### Sample Applications

- API Service 1: Simple health check API
- API Service 2: Database-connected API
- Web App: Frontend application

## Phase 3: Enterprise Features 📅 Future

### Advanced Networking

- Private endpoints
- Application Gateway
- WAF configuration

### Monitoring & Security

- Azure Monitor integration
- Log Analytics workspace
- Security baseline

## Learning Progress & Key Decisions

### Modularity Strategy ✅ Established

**Modules Created:**
- **Networking:** High reuse across 3+ environments, complex subnet/NSG configuration
- **AKS:** Complex multi-node configuration, RBAC, monitoring integration

**Kept Inline:**
- **ACR:** Simple configuration, shared across environments (not duplicated)
- **PostgreSQL:** Environment-specific sizing, low complexity
- **Key Vault:** Simple per-environment secrets

### Container Strategy ✅ Refined

**Enterprise Pattern: Single Shared ACR with Tag Promotion**

```text
Registry: sharedlearnacr.azurecr.io
├── api-service-1/
│   ├── v1.2.3-commit-abc123    # Immutable build artifact
│   ├── dev-ready               # Environment promotion tag
│   ├── staging-ready           # Manual approval gate
│   └── prod-ready              # Production readiness
```

**Benefits Realized:**
- ✅ True immutable deployments (same binary across environments)
- ✅ Cost optimization (single Basic ACR ~$5/month vs 3×$5)
- ✅ Clear audit trail (production image traceable to exact commit)
- ✅ Simplified RBAC (centralized access control)

**vs. Environment-Specific Registries:**
- ❌ More expensive (3×$5/month)
- ❌ Risk of environment drift (different builds)
- ❌ Complex promotion (cross-registry operations)

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **Terraform Service Principal Permissions**
   - **Challenge:** AKS-ACR integration requires role assignments
   - **Root Cause:** Terraform SP has Contributor, needs User Access Administrator/Owner
   - **Solution:** Temporary Owner elevation for learning environment
   - **Enterprise Pattern:** Separate infrastructure vs. permissions management

2. **Module Design Decisions**
   - **Challenge:** Balance reusability vs. complexity
   - **Learning:** Only modularize when clear reuse justification (3+ uses)
   - **Result:** Networking (3 environments) and AKS (complex) became modules

## Daily Budget Tracking

| Date | Services Running | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| Day 1-3 | Terraform backend setup | ~$0.50/day | Storage only |
| Day 4-6 | + Dev AKS + ACR | ~$2.00/day | Single node AKS + Basic ACR |
| Current | Foundation phase | ~$2.50/day | Target achieved ✅ |

**Cost Optimization Measures:**
- ✅ Daily destroy/rebuild scripts
- ✅ Single-node AKS for development
- ✅ Basic ACR SKU (not Standard/Premium)
- ✅ Resource tagging for cost tracking

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Module Design Philosophy**
   - Only create modules for high-reuse, complex components
   - Simple resources (ACR, Key Vault) work better inline
   - Module interfaces should be minimal and stable

2. **Enterprise Container Strategy**
   - Shared registries with tag promotion > environment-specific registries
   - Immutable artifacts with environment tagging provides best audit trail
   - Cost benefits significant at scale

3. **Service Principal Management**
   - Infrastructure deployment vs. permission management often need different roles
   - Learning environments can use elevated permissions temporarily
   - Production would use separate service principals with principle of least privilege

4. **Cost Control Strategy**
   - Daily destroy/rebuild prevents bill shock
   - Basic SKUs sufficient for learning/development
   - Resource tagging essential for tracking

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Resolve Service Principal Permissions** - Grant temporary Owner role
2. **Complete ACR Integration** - Fix naming and test AKS pull permissions  
3. **Deploy First Application** - Test complete build → tag → deploy workflow
4. **Document Promotion Process** - Create reusable promotion scripts

**Success Criteria for Phase 1:**
